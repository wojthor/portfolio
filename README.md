# Portfolio — Next.js App

A personal portfolio built with Next.js (App Router). Lightweight starter configured for development, testing, and deployment.

## Features

- Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
- Server and client components
- Optimized font loading with next/font
- Hot reloading and fast refresh
- Ready for Vercel deployment

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- CSS / Tailwind / your preferred styling (optional)

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- npm, Yarn, pnpm, or Bun

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

2. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site. Edit `app/page.tsx` and other files to customize content — the page updates automatically.

## Build & production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
# or
yarn build && yarn start
# or
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

## Project structure (typical)

- app/ — Next.js App Router pages and layout
  - page.tsx — homepage
  - layout.tsx — root layout
- components/ — reusable UI components
- public/ — static assets (images, icons)
- styles/ — global styles or utilities
- next.config.js, tsconfig.json, package.json

Adjust structure to match your codebase as needed.

## Fonts & assets

This project uses next/font to optimize fonts. Update font configuration in `app/layout.tsx` or wherever fonts are imported.

## Environment

If your portfolio integrates APIs or analytics, add environment variables in `.env.local`. Example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your_id
```

## Deployment

Recommended: Vercel

- Push the repo to GitHub/GitLab and import to Vercel
- Vercel will detect Next.js and provide zero-config deployment

Other hosts that support Next.js are also compatible (Netlify, Render).

## Contributing

- Fork the repo, create a branch, and open a pull request.
- Keep changes small and documented.

## License

Add a LICENSE file or set a license in package.json (e.g., MIT).
